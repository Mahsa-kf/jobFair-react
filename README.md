## Challenges:
1. Slideshow:
        One of the challenges I had was about showing slides that weren't working correctly, and I found that was related to the size of the pictures. I resized the images and did work.

2. Scroll issue on map:        
        When I was trying to scroll the site, I had a problem with the map because the scroll button did not work and instead zoomed in /out. For this, I did some research and found how I can disable scroll on the map.

4. Issue with API deployment:
        I had a challenge deploying the backend side with web API because my host is Linux host. For deploying the asp.net web services, I need to deploy it in windows IIS. For now, I skipped buying a new host and just deployed the frontend.

 5. Cross-Origin Issue:
        When I was trying to send a request from frontend to web API in my localhost, I was getting CORS error that "NO Access-control allow-origin" to results that I did some research and found that I need to add the following code in web API APP_Start/WebApiConfiq.
